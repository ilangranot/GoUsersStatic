# GoUsers App Frontend

This is the client (Static frontend). For the Server (back-end) see https://github.com/ilangranot/GoUsersApp

GoUsers attempts to help users interact with any software they are not familiar with. The GoUsers tool (US patents US 10,846,105, US11,157,294, US11,567,787) helps novice users by showing them suggestions about how the more experienced users have used that software. Our tool is automatic since it uses self-learning to show suggestions to users, and it is universal in the sense that it could be implemented in most existing software without special changes to the code. Primarily we intend to provide our tool to cloud software companies as an API to improve the UX/UI of their current software.
